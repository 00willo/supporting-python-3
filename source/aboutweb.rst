About this book
===========================================================================

This book is written in reStructuredText\ [#rest]_, typeset with 
Sphinx\ [#sphinx]_ and LaTeX\ [#latex]_ and printed on 
CreateSpace\ [#createspace]_. The typefaces used are TeX Gyre Schola for the 
main text, DejaVu Sans Mono for the code and Flux Bold for headings.

The cover photo is taken by **Emmanuel "Tambako" Keller**,

Almost all the code examples are unit tested, but there are likely to be many
bugs in the text, so there will be a list of errata on the books web page,
http://python3porting.com/.

I would like to thank the following persons for helping making this book much
better:

**Brett Cannon** for writing the foreword.

**Martin von LÃ¶wis** for indispensable feedback with his technical
review of the book, as well as helping a lot on early porting work, like
Distribute and zope.interface.

**Godefroid Chapelle**, **Jasper Spaans** and **Wyn Williams** for reviewing the
book for content, grammar and errors.

**Brandon Craig Rhodes** for editing the first chapters of this book when the
idea was that it would be a series of articles in Python Magazine.
