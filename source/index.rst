Welcome!
========

**Supporting Python 3** doesn't have to be daunting. This book guides you
through the process of adding Python 3 support, from choosing a
strategy to solving your distribution issues. Using plenty of code
examples, it guides you across the hurdles and shows you the new Python features.

2016-10-23: The first release of the community version!
-------------------------------------------------------

After almost a year of delay, the community version of the book is finally
here! The book has been renamed to "Supporting Python 3" to signal both that
something happened to the book, and to signal that it's no longer a question
of porting.

Another change is that this site will be rebuilt on a nightly basis, so it's
always the latest version. I have also retired the paper version completely.
If you want to sponsor a print run of the paper book, contact me! They make
good giveaways for Python conferences!

There are also PDF versions for screen_, which will also fit an A4 and letter
paper, tablets_ and phones_ available for download.
