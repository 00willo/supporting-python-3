Welcome!
========

**Supporting Python 3** doesn't have to be daunting. This book guides you
through the process of adding Python 3 support, from choosing a
strategy to solving your distribution issues. Using plenty of code
examples, it guides you across the hurdles and shows you the new Python features.

2016-10-23: The first release of the community version!
-------------------------------------------------------

After almost a year of delay, the community version of the book is finally
here! The book has been renamed to "Supporting Python 3" to signal both that
something happened to the book, and to signal that it's no longer a question
of porting.

Another change is that this site will be rebuilt on a nightly basis, so it's
always the latest version. I'll also retire the paper and PDF versions
completely.
